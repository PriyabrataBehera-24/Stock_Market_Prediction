# Stock Market Prediction | Machine Learning Project
Welcome to the "Stock Market Prediction" project repository! This project aims to provide practical experience in predicting stock market prices using various machine learning models, including LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks and traditional machine learning algorithms. The project simulates a real-world corporate environment, emphasizing the entire process from problem definition to model implementation and evaluation.

## Project Overview
This project involves predicting stock prices using historical data. The goal is to create accurate predictive models to facilitate data-driven investment decisions. We use LSTM networks (peephole, vanilla, and depth-gated) and other machine learning models such as Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to achieve this.

## Problem Statement
The stock market is highly volatile, and predicting its movements is challenging due to the complexity and non-linearity of the data. This project aims to develop models that can predict stock prices accurately, helping investors to make informed decisions.

## Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up the project locally on your machine.

## Prerequisites
1.Python (preferably version 3.6 or higher)

2.Jupyter Notebook or any other Python IDE

3.Basic knowledge of machine learning and time series analysis

## Instructions to Setup the Project
1.Install Python on your local computer if not already installed.

2.Install the required Python libraries using the following command :

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn keras tensorflow matplotlib

3.Download the provided Python script file (minor_project.py) to your local computer.

4.Open the Python script file in Jupyter Notebook or any other Python IDE.

## Usage
1.Open the Python script file (minor_project.py) in Jupyter Notebook or any other Python IDE.

2.Run the script to train the models and evaluate their performance.
